    <p>
      My name is Stalin Vasquez and I'm building my blog app to improve my skills on Ruby on Rails and coding in general.</p>
    <p>
      As a junior web developer with a background in Civil Engineer I enjoy writing come to build app that make peoples live easier, better, more enjoyable. I finished working on a Shazam like app called Mike, an app that makes you sounds smart, lets say you're in the middle of a conversation or taking class, the app will listen and it will give you the most relevant feedback through the IBM artificial intelligence API, even if you have no idea what they’re talking about from science to baseball, I come from the same country as Jose Bautista (we’re not friends) but if you meeting and have the app on your phone you can have a conversation with Him and sounds pretty knowledgable about the Dominican Republic.</p>
